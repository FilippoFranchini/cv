I devise tools that help people to [fill data gaps and make predictions](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20442041.2017.1294351), to [automate and efficiently boost](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00277/full) labour-intensive and time-consuming calculations, and to understand [complex systems](https://www.biogeosciences.net/14/5765/2017). I [improved protocols](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F8623_2016_206) and devised the first quiet multi-rotor [acoustic drone](https://www.facebook.com/earflydrones/) to map sound sources from the air using only acoustic information.I am currently searching for a position that allows me to apply and improve my coding skills as well as develop new methods and instruments using statistics, software engineering, machine learning and artificial intelligence."
